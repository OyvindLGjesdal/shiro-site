The Apache Shiro team is pleased to announce the ongoing work on the javax -> jakarta namespace transition!

We aim to provide first jakarta artifacts of Shiro with the release of **1.10.0** going the same route as other Apache projects by using relocations. The resulting jakarta artifacts are later distributed via Maven classifiers.

== Feedback appreciated!

We need **your** help in testing our relocated artifacts. Feel free to try https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/shiro/[our nightly snapshots], to link:/issues.html[open an issue], or to write us a message to the link:/mailing-lists.html[developer's mailing list]!
