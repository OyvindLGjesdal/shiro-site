=== link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22602[CVE-2023-22602]

When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass.
The authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching.

**Mitigation:** Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value:

```properties
spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher
```

**Credit:**
Apache Shiro would like to thank v3ged0ge and Adamytd for reporting this issue.

=== Bug

* [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-903[SHIRO-903]] - Shiro must use ant pattern matching with Spring
* [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-899[SHIRO-899]] - Jakarta 9+ fails with Shiro native sessions

=== Improvement

* [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-889[SHIRO-889]] - Provide Jakarta jar modules
