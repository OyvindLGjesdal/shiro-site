Before you can use Java annotations, you'll need to enable AOP support in your application. There are a number of different AOP frameworks so, unfortunately, there is no standard way to enable AOP in an application.

For AspectJ, you can review our [AspectJ sample application](https://github.com/apache/shiro/tree/main/samples/aspectj).

For Spring, you can look into our [Spring Integration](spring.html "Spring") documentation.

## Shiro's Java Annotations.

Once you have AOP enabled in our application, you can use Shiro's set of annotations found in the [Java Annotations List](java-annotations-list.html "Java Annotations List")
